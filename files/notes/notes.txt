PsiBuilder: This has been built for LL parsing. It is not compatible with LR parsing in the usual way.

Workaround: Mark at start. Use psiBuilder.advanceLexer() to read all tokens and feed them to the parser. Do not build
	an AST but rather record all shift and reduce steps (might have to use a tree for recording, but that's not an
	AST, rather it's very similar to the concrete derivation tree). rollbackTo() the marker at start, then execute the
	recorded steps and set the actual markers.
