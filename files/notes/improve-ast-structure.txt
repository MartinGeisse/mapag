- (inline "present" case for optionals) or (use single generic class for all optionals)
    The intention was to use a single generic class for all optionals. This isn't happening at the moment.
    Either:
        (1) use a single generic class for all optionals. Turn the optionals' nonterminal names into something long
            since they won't be visible anyway, and use the short, readable name for the operand.
        (2) inline the "present" case. This is best done by the canonicalizer.

    --> I like the "single generic class" approach more, even though it requires an additional AST node. But it
        produces fewer classes and less cryptic names.

- inline repetition elements. No inlining of the elements' contents into the repeition nodes is required or possible
    after that, because there aren't any enclosing repetition nodes anymore (only a single parent node for all elements).
